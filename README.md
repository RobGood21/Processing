Hi  guys,
This is a study repository for interfacing processing with arduino projects. I have made several projects for modeltrain And several projects for
puzzles in escaperooms (sorry those are not public available). So I want to control future projects with windows or linux systems (raspberry). 
Start will be pretty dull i am afraid but who knows where it will take me.... feel free to use the ideas.
Rob
